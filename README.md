## 2.1. Main methodological task

The main challenge when analysing the impact of neighborhood legalization in Bogot√°, is that the porgram is that legalized "neighborhoods" do not feet into the geografical limits of cadastral neighborhoods. Thus, is hard to define comparable units other than the rest of legalized neighborhoods (therefore there wouldn't be "never treated units").
